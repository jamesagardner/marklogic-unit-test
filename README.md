# Testing MarkLogic

marklogic-unit-test is an [ml-gradle bundle](https://github.com/marklogic-community/ml-gradle/wiki/Bundles) that allows
a project to test MarkLogic code.  With one import a project immediately has access to:

1. A framework for writing and running MarkLogic unit tests, including several built in assertion functions
1. A UI for viewing and running unit tests entirely within MarkLogic
1. A REST endpoint to run and report unit tests with other tools

Testing MarkLogic from a Java project is made easy with marklogic-junit:

1. Write MarkLogic tests entirely from Java
1. Easily integrate MarkLogic unit tests into your favorite Java testing frameworks
